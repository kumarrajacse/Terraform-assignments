Adding Maps and Lookups in your Terraform files
The lab files can be found @ https://github.com/satyensingh/terraform-assignment-resources.git
In the repo you will find main.tf, outputs.tf, and variables.tf.
Add a new variable called env. Set a description to “env: dev or prod”.
Convert the type from image_name to map.

Change the default to use key/value pairs. Set dev to ghost:latest and prod to ghost:alpine.

Convert container_name to a map. Change the default to use key/value pairs. Set dev to blog_dev and prod to blog_prod.

Convert ext_port to a map. Change the default to use key/value pairs. Set dev to 8080 and prod to 80.

Now initialize Terraform.

Setup the Development environment
Create a workspace called dev.
Generate a Terraform plan. Output the plan and call it tfdev_plan. Pass in a variable called env and set it to dev.
Apply tfdev_plan.

Setup the Production environment
Create a workspace called prod.
Generate a Terraform plan. Output the plan and call it tfprod_plan. Pass in a variable called env and set it to prod.
Apply tfprod_plan.

Verify both environments work
Open a browser and navigate to the public IP. This should pull up the production environment.
Open a browser tab and navigate to the public IP on port 8080. This should pull up the development environment.

so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.
